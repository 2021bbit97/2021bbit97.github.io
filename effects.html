                <h3>When cannabis is inhaled, the components that are present  in it are absorbed in the bloodstream  by the help of lungs and then they are spread in our body reaching towards the most sensitive part of the human body, the human brain. The  immediate and delayed effects depend upon the method of intake of TCHA . Also the compounds, along with this medicinal drug is taken into our body depend a lot because they can change the impacts of this drug on human body. Usually, it is grouped with THC   (tetrahydrocannabinol).</h3>

                    <h2>If it is inhaled directly then the consumer will show up with rapid effects . These effects  include a  sense of joy(euphoria) , increased hunger and  hyperesthesia  that is heightened sensory perception  . This will only take 5-10 minutes for its reaction to our body . This reaction is highly linked with interaction of THCA and THC  with the endocannabinoid system in the brain.</h2></div>
                <div style="flex-grow: 1;"><h3>Delayed effects:</h3>
                    <h2>When cannabis compounds are undertaken  in  food and drinks, the onset effect will be slower. This will take  30 minutes to 1 hour after the consumption . This happens because of the metabolic activity in our stomach .When THC is smoked  its ratio is comparatively larger  then  when it is taken orally. Because of the delayed reactions people take large amounts of THC in their body  that can be harmful for their health.</h2></div>

                    <h3>Cognition:  Cognition refers to a range of mental processes relating to acquiring, storing, manipulating, and retrieving information. It underpins many daily activities in health and disease across the age span.THCA  helps in the smooth working of the brain’s cognition function. It also regulates neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells) and synaptic plasticity (the ability of brain cells to communicate and adapt). It also minimizes the negative effects of TCH by keeping the amount of TCHA  low in the brain.
