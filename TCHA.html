                    ·THCA has potential health benefits, such as supporting healthy inflammation and promoting relaxation. At the same time, THC has been studied for its pain relief, anti-nausea, and appetite-stimulating properties.
                    ·THC is present in smoking or vaping. At the same time, THCA can be consumed by juicing or raw cannabis

                <h3>WORKING</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">THCA has its receptor sites in our body the activation of CB1 and CB2 is linked with THC that are present in our defensive system and the main coordinate organ that is our brain. THCA cannot take these receptor sites. For the working of THCA, it activates the FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase). This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of an endocannabinoid called anandamide.</p>




                    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Anandamide (ANA), also known as N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), an N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE), is a fatty acid neurotransmitter.  The combination of FAAH enzyme and THCA increases the level of anandamide that helps to regulate mood, pain, memory, etc.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                   <p style="text-align: justify;"> THCA does not bind to these receptors but rather modulates their activity indirectly. For instance, THCA can inhibit an enzyme called FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase), which breaks down an endocannabinoid called anandamide. Anandamide is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, pain, appetite, memory, and more. By inhibiting FAAH, THCA can increase the levels of anandamide in our body and enhance its effects.
                    Some other receptor sites are not related to ESC but they play a vital role in biological processes that THCA activates.TRPA1 regulates pain, swelling, and thermal sensation after the stimulation that occurs by THCA. It is also helpful in reducing pain and inflammation.
                    Furthermore, the activation of the PPARγ receptor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is also controlled by THCA. It assures the normal functioning of DNA, breaking down large molecules into smaller inflammations. With the help of PPARγ, THCA guards our brain by keeping it away from oxidative stress, inflammation, or neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h3>EFFETS</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">When cannabis is inhaled, the components that are present  in it are absorbed in the bloodstream  by the help of lungs and then they are spread in our body reaching towards the most sensitive part of the human body, the human brain. The  immediate and delayed effects depend upon the method of intake of TCHA . Also the compounds, along with this medicinal drug is taken into our body depend a lot because they can change the impacts of this drug on human body. Usually, it is grouped with THC   (tetrahydrocannabinol).</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Immediately effects:</b>If it is inhaled directly then the consumer will show up with rapid effects . These effects  include a  sense of joy(euphoria) , increased hunger and  hyperesthesia  that is heightened sensory perception  . This will only take 5-10 minutes for its reaction to our body . This reaction is highly linked with interaction of THCA and THC  with the endocannabinoid system in the brain.</p>
                   <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Delayed effects:</b>When cannabis compounds are undertaken  in  food and drinks, the onset effect will be slower. This will take  30 minutes to 1 hour after the consumption . This happens because of the metabolic activity in our stomach .When THC is smoked  its ratio is comparatively larger  then  when it is taken orally. Because of the delayed reactions people take large amounts of THC in their body  that can be harmful for their health.</p>
